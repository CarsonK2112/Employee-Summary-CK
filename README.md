# Employee Summary

I admit that I am in a rush to submit this as the deadline is coming up. That is entirely on me for waiting until the last minute, but I have attempted to create an app as per the instructions of this assignment. Namely to create a team generator that stores and adds team members as per their employee role through the command line. HTML is generated through the output folder team.html, however I admit that I have not yet tested it. I intend to create a brief video explaining the command line and unfortunately that's it.
